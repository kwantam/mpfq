Testing programs.
-----------------

Typing
  make all_tests
will build and run many test binaries that will check some arithmetic
equality in the finite fields implemented in Mpfq.

If you want to test a single TAG, try something like:
  make do-test-2_23
or
  make do-test-p_25519

If you need to run heavy tests on a particular field, you can give more
options to the test binary. Examples follow.

# Run 20 loops of 1000 tests in GF(2^251), with a seed of 87653
make mpfq_test_2_251
./mpfq_test_2_251 -N 20 -n 1000 -s 87653

# Run an infinite loop of 10000 tests in GF(p) with p of 2 words
# in a quiet mode, printing one dot per loop.
# In case of failure, it will print the seed to replay the buggy inputs.
make mpfq_test_p_2
./mpfq_test_p_2 -N 0 -q -n 10000
